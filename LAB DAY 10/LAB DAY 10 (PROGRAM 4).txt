4. Write a function display_words() in python to read lines from a text file "story.txt",
 and display those words, which are less than 4 characters


def display_words():
    try:
        # Open the file in read mode
        with open("story.txt", 'r') as file:
            print("Words with less than 4 characters from 'story.txt':")

            # Iterate through each line in the file
            for line in file:
                # Split the line into words
                words = line.split()
                
                # Display words with length less than 4
                for word in words:
                    if len(word) < 4:
                        print(word)

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: The file 'story.txt' was not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Call the function to display words
