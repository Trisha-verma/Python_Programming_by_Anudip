 3. Write a function in Python to count uppercase character in a text file “ABC.txt”


def count_uppercase_in_file():
    try:
        # Open the file in read mode
        with open("ABC.txt", 'r') as file:
            # Initialize a counter for uppercase characters
            uppercase_count = 0

            # Read the file line by line
            for line in file:
                # Iterate through each character in the line
                for char in line:
                    # Check if the character is an uppercase letter
                    if char.isupper():
                        uppercase_count += 1

            # Display the total count of uppercase characters
            print(f"The total number of uppercase characters in 'ABC.txt' is: {uppercase_count}")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: The file 'ABC.txt' was not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Call the function
count_uppercase_in_file()
