 2. Write a function in Python to count and display the total number of words in a text
 file â€œABC.txt

def count_words_in_file():
    try:
        # Open the file in read mode
        with open("ABC.txt", 'r') as file:
            # Initialize a variable to store the word count
            word_count = 0

            # Iterate through each line in the file
            for line in file:
                # Split each line into words based on whitespace
                words = line.split()

                # Add the number of words in the current line to the word count
                word_count += len(words)

            # Display the total word count
            print(f"The total number of words in 'ABC.txt' is: {word_count}")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: The file 'ABC.txt' was not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Call the function
count_words_in_file()
