 1. Write a function in python to read the content from a text file "ABC.txt" line by line
 and display the same on screen



def read_file_line_by_line():
    try:
        # Open the file in read mode
        with open("ABC.txt", 'r') as file:
            print("Content of 'ABC.txt':")
            
            # Read the file line by line
            for line in file:
                # Display each line
                print(line, end='')  # 'end' ensures no extra newline is added

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: The file 'ABC.txt' was not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Call the function
read_file_line_by_line()
