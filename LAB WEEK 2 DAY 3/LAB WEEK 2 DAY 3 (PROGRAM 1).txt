Write a Python program to count the occurrences of each word in a
given sentence.
string = “To change the overall look of your document. To change the look
available in the gallery”


# Input sentence
string = "To change the overall look of your document. To change the look available in the gallery"

# Preprocess the string: Convert to lowercase and remove punctuation
import string as str_module
sentence = string.lower().translate(str_module.maketrans("", "", str_module.punctuation))

# Split the sentence into words
words = sentence.split()

# Create a dictionary to count occurrences
word_count = {}

for word in words:
    if word in word_count:
        word_count[word] += 1
    else:
        word_count[word] = 1

# Print the word count dictionary
print("Word occurrences:")
for word, count in word_count.items():
    print(f"{word}: {count}")
