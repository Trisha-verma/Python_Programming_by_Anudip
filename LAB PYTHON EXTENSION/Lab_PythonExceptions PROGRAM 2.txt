2. Write a Python program that opens a file and handles a FileNotFoundError exception
if the file does not exist



def open_file():
    try:
        # Prompt the user for the file name
        file_name = input("Enter the file name to open: ")

        # Try to open the file in read mode
        with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
            print("File content:")
            print(content)

    except FileNotFoundError:
        # Handle the case when the file is not found
        print(f"Error: The file '{file_name}' does not exist.")

# Call the function to open the file
open_file()
