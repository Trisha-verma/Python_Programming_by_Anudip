1. Write a function in Python to count and display the total number of words in a text
file “ABC.txt”


def count_words_in_file(file_name):
    try:
        # Open the file in read mode
        with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
            # Read the contents of the file
            content = file.read()

            # Split the content into words
            words = content.split()

            # Count the words
            word_count = len(words)

            # Display the total number of words
            print(f"The total number of words in '{file_name}' is: {word_count}")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"The file '{file_name}' was not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")


# Call the function with the file name
count_words_in_file("ABC.txt")
